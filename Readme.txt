-I had a very difficult time with this week's assignment at almost every step.  
The dropdown menu was particularily frusturating for me as even after hours of
trying to figure out what was going wrong, I still couldnt figure it out.  I 
read all the w3 articles on drop-down menus and even double checked my code against 
other pages that had working drop-downs and it still wont work.  I feel like 
it is probably some small error that I am overlooking in my code but at this point 
I'm completely stumped.

While I did have a hard time with many aspects of this weeks assignment, I did enjoy
the higher level of control and creativity CSS provides and am really excited about 
getting better at it so the process will be smoother and I can focus more energy on 
creative design instead of spending hours searching through my code to figure out
where I went wrong.  I particularly enjoyed that I now have more control of the colors
on the page.  As my page was centered around cooking, I chose a color scheme with with
extremely muted cool-leaning tones of orange and purple.  I chose these colors because 
they are analagous colors to red on the color wheel, which in color theory is associated
with making people hungry.  I chose to go with my color scheme because full red seemed 
a bit to obnoxious to use anywhere on the page.

This week I did respond to a comment on the issue repo, someone else was having trouble
with the dropdown menu and floating their boxes.  Unfortunately I was in the same boat 
with the dropdown so I couldn't offer any help with that but I did have the same problem with 
floating that I did manage to fix. What worked for me was adjusting the width percentages 
for the collumns until they both floated next to eachother properly.  It took me forever to
figure out what the problem was but hopefully it helped the person who had a similar problem!
